    <h3>Data Types in Javascript</h3>
    <h4>There are eight basic data types in JavaScript</h4>
    <h5>Numbers</h5>
    <p>The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers. There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, etc.</p>
    n = 12.345;
    <h5>Big Integer</h5>
    <p>In JavaScript, the “number” type cannot represent integer values larger than (253-1) (that’s 9007199254740991), or less than -(-253-1) for negatives.</p>
    
    const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890;

    <h5>String</h5>
    <p>A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.</p>
    let str = "Hello";
let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';
let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`;
<h5>Boolean</h5>
<p>The boolean type has only two values: true and false.</p>
let isGreater = 4 > 1;(true)


<h5>Null</h5>
<p>The special null value does not belong to any of the types</p>
let age = null;


<h5>Undefined</h5>
<P>The special value undefined also stands apart.

    The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.
    
    If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined:</P>
    let age;

    <h5>Objects & Symbol</h5>
    <p>
        The object type is special.

All other types are called “primitive” because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.</p>


<p>The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects. 


    </p>

    <h5> Type of operator</h5>
    <p>The typeof operator returns the type of the argument. It’s useful when we want to process values of different types differently or just want to do a quick check.

       <p> It supports two forms of syntax:</p>
        
        <p>As an operator: typeof x.</p>
       <p> As a function: typeof(x).</p>
